Application Structure
App.js
The App.js file is the main component of the application. It sets up routes, renders components based on the route, and manages user authentication state using Redux. Notable components include Login, Register, Home, Brands, and Header.

config.js
The config.js file defines a configuration object, app_config, containing the backend URL. This file follows good practice, allowing for easy changes to the backend URL without modifying code in multiple places.

index.js
The index.js file initializes the React application, renders the App component, and provides the Redux store to the entire application using the Provider component.

Usage
To run the application:

Clone the repository.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Run the application with npm start.
Configuration
To configure the backend URL, update the backend_url property in the config.js file.

javascript
// config.js
const app_config = {
    backend_url: "http://localhost:5001",
};

export default app_config;
Redux Store
The application uses Redux for state management. The Redux store is configured in the store.js file, which is not provided in the code snippet. Ensure that the Redux store is set up with the necessary reducers and middleware.

Contributing
Contributions to the application are welcome. If you find issues or want to enhance features, please submit pull requests or open issues in the repository.

Usage
Subscribing to Events
To subscribe to an event, use the on method:

javascript
import eventBus from './path-to-event-bus';

const callback = (data) => {
  // Handle the event data
  console.log('Event received:', data);
};

eventBus.on('customEvent', callback);
Emitting Events
To emit an event, use the dispatch method:

javascript
import eventBus from './path-to-event-bus';

const eventData = { key: 'value' };
eventBus.dispatch('customEvent', eventData);
Unsubscribing from Events
To unsubscribe from an event, use the remove method:

javascript
import eventBus from './path-to-event-bus';

// Assuming the same callback function from the subscription example
eventBus.remove('customEvent', callback);
Example
javascript
import eventBus from './path-to-event-bus';

// Subscribe to an event
const subscriptionCallback = (data) => {
  console.log('Event received:', data);
};
eventBus.on('customEvent', subscriptionCallback);

// Emit an event
const eventData = { key: 'value' };
eventBus.dispatch('customEvent', eventData);

// Unsubscribe from the event
eventBus.remove('customEvent', subscriptionCallback);
